# rsid (Single Session Revision Save ID)

They are completely random, and are only used for seeing where things match. So they aren't of much use unless you are merging with another document that also has RSIDs." So you can generate appropriate random numbers. As to conflicts, a list of them is stored in one of the properties parts. Do you really need to add them? They only improve certain compare/diff cases.
